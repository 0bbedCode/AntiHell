When Selecting a Repo, PLEASE see if you can click the link to the TXT file first to see if it redirects you, then copy and use the Redirect Link

Though the "Simple Host Bocker" does support re-formating the URL Correctly so it can grab the last update TimeStamp
Its best to actually open the URL and copy the redirected URL
If we click it the new URL appears as:

Once upon opening if it downloads the host you can try adding .txt to the end of the URL , and or just direct copy that URL
